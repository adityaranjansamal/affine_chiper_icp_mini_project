The Affine Cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a unique letter in the ciphertext by using a mathematical formula. In Java, it can be implemented as follows:Initialize two key values 'a' and 'b', where 'a' must be a positive integer greater than 0 and less than the size of the alphabet being used, and 'b' can be any integer.Convert each letter of the plaintext to its numerical representation (for example, 'A' = 0, 'B' = 1, ..., 'Z' = 25).Compute the numerical representation of the ciphertext letter for each plaintext letter by using the formula:c = (a * m + b) % 26where 'm' is the numerical representation of the plaintext letter and 'c' is the numerical representation of the ciphertext letter.Convert each numerical representation of the ciphertext letter back to its corresponding letter.Repeat the process for each letter in the plaintext.
